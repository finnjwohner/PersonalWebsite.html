# PersonalWebsite.html
This is the personal website I worked on back in mid 2020 just to show people that I know how to use HTML &amp; CSS as well as a little JavaScript when applying for internships.

[View it here](https://frrinz.github.io/PersonalWebsite.html/)

## What does it use?
This website uses (obviously) HTML, CSS & Java, aswell as [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) to make the CSS have a wider compatability on different browsers. It was made in Visual Studio Code alongside the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension
